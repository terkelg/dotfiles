# A quick outline of what must be done to get everything working.

# 1) Install the dependencies.
brew install gnupg gpg-agent pinentry-mac

# 2) Configure git to automatically gpgsign commits. This consists of
#    pointing git to your signing key ID, and then enabling commit
#    automatic signing.
git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR-SIGNING-KEY-PUB-ID>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# 3) Configure the GPG components (see above for relevant examples):
#    ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
#    ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

# 4) Start the daemon and configure your shell (see above for example in .profile).
#    ~/.bash_profile | ~/.zshrc

# Don't forget to upload your public key to Github!

# Note: There needs to be a three-way match on your email for Github to show
# the commit as 'verified': The commit email, github email, & the email associated with the public key
